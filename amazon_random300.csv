review;sentiment
It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.;0
I have two more years left in this contract and I hate this phone.;0
If you don't find it, too bad, as again the unit comes with one earpad only.I would not recommend this to anyone.;0
Pretty piece of junk.;0
Linked to my phone without effort.;1
Highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone.;1
If you hate earbugs, avoid this phone by all means.;0
Great software for Motorolas.;1
dont buy it.;0
I would have given no star if I was able.;0
Product is useless, since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones I was planning to use it with.;0
I got it because it was so small and adorable.;1
Setup went very smoothly.;1
Unfortunately it did not work.;0
I still maintain that monkeys shouldn't make headphones, we just obviously don't share enough DNA to copy the design over to humans.;0
You need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phone.Battery life is short.;0
So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.;0
This battery is an excellent bargain!;1
1. long lasting battery (you don't have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones)2.;0
This is a great little item.;1
poor quality and service.;0
It is the best charger I have seen on the market yet.;1
It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.;1
This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.;0
I was looking for this headset for a long time and now that I've got it I couldn't be happier.;1
It has all the features I want;1
Fantastic earphones.;1
The bottowm line...another worthless, cheap gimmick from Sprint.;0
I was not happy with this item.;0
However I needed some better instructions.;0
bad fit, way too big.;0
Exactly what I wanted.;1
It finds my cell phone right away when I enter the car.;1
Great Phone.;1
Used and dirty.;0
Clear crisp sound.;1
Don't waste your money!.;0
Very disappointed in AccessoryOne.;0
It only recognizes the Phone as its storage device.;0
* Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash SOS signals (seriously!;1
This is a good battery, and it got here really fast.;1
Truly awful.;0
Display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year.;1
Very good stuff for the price.;1
Also makes it easier to hold on to.;1
They work about 2 weeks then break.;0
Earbud piece breaks easily.;0
Worth every penny.;1
i'm glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find, it wasn't high priced.;1
Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.;0
Magical Help.;1
This phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone.;0
Piece of trash.;0
The mic is great.;1
the phone was unusable and was not new.;0
My headset works just peachy-keen.;1
useless phone, simply deaf.;0
This pair of headphones is the worst that I have ever had sound-wise.;0
However, the keypads are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong buttons.;0
I own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better.;1
Not a good item.. It worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player.;0
NOT WHAT I WANTED.;0
Saggy, floppy piece of junk.;0
Very satisifed with that.;1
I ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately.;0
This product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless.;0
All in all, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase.;1
We would recommend these to others.;1
Does not fit.;0
Verizon's bills, however, are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple.;0
A week later after I activated it, it suddenly died.;0
Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.;1
This is a great phone!.;1
The reception is excellent!;1
But, in any case, the best part is, you can download these pictures to your laptop using IR, or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone.;1
I got the aluminum case for my new Palm VX and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far.;1
All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes.The more I use the thing the less I like it.;0
So far it has worked like a charm.;1
I ordered this for sony Ericsson W810i but I think it only worked once (thats when I first used it).;0
Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone.;0
It defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset.;0
Poor Talk Time Performance.;0
It is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed.;0
great...no problems at all!.;1
My 5-year old Nokia 2160 from Tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this.;0
I don't like this Nokia either.;0
DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS;0
It is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip.;1
Nice docking station for home or work.;1
Worst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would.;0
This is by far the worst purchase I've made on Amazon.;0
Well packaged, arrived on time, and works as intended.;1
I know that sounds funny, but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldn't work well.Well, this one works great.;1
Excellent product, I am very satisfied with the purchase.;1
It works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time.;1
After trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well.;1
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.;0
How stupid is that?;0
The keyboard is a nice compromise between a full QWERTY and the basic cell phone number keypad.;1
The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked.;0
I own 2 of these cases and would order another.;1
Best I've found so far .... I've tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality (for both me and the listener) as well as ease of using.;1
My colleague & I now get great reception.A little expensive, but performance is great.;1
EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!!!!!!.;1
Not as good as I had hoped.;0
Light weight, I hardly notice it is there.;1
First off the reception sucks, I have never had more than 2 bars, ever.;0
Restored my phone to like new performance.;1
Also the area where my unit broke).- I'm not too fond of the magnetic strap.;0
Timely shipment and quality product.;1
O my gosh the best phone I have ever had.;1
It doesn't make you look cool.;0
I love this bluetooth!;1
What a waste of time!;0
I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.;1
Great case and price!;1
The sound quality is good and functionality is awesome.;1
Iam very pleased with my purchase.;1
I gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality.;1
No buyers remorse on this one!.;0
They do not care about the consumer one bit.;0
doesn't last long.;0
Bluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked.;0
Does everything it should and more.;1
It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon.;0
I was very impressed with the price of the cases.;1
Five star Plus, plus.;1
Don't buy this product.;0
It is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone, and excels in those roles.;1
The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.;1
The loudspeaker option is great, the bumpers with the lights is very ... appealing.;0
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor.;0
I searched the Internet, and found this one to be the best value.;1
It also had a new problem.;0
I have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume.;0
I have purchased these for both family and friends, and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use;1
After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.;0
Excellent bluetooth headset.;1
It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it.;0
The plug did not work very well.;0
Internet is excrutiatingly slow.;0
Not a good bargain.;0
I use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment, and it works great!;1
Very well made and fits my Surefire GX2 perfectly.;1
After a year the battery went completely dead on my headset.;0
Otherwise, easy to install and use, clear sound.;1
This is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate.;0
Still Waiting...... I'm sure this item would work well.. if I ever recieve it!;0
The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad.;0
Works well.;1
Nice headphones for the price and they work great!;1
Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.;1
Small, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place.;1
Best of all is the rotating feature, very helpful.;1
Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.;0
What a piece of junk.. I lose more calls on this phone.;0
Poor product.;0
You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not.;0
You have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly.;0
Great phone.;1
don't waste your money.;0
The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone.;0
Disappointment.. I hate anything that goes in my ear.;0
I'll be looking for a new earpiece.;0
Voice recognition is tremendous!;1
Lousy product.;0
"I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice.";0
but it is great, i would really recommend it;1
Bad Reception.;0
Thank you for such great service.;1
Great product and price.;1
I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.;0
It was a great phone.;1
One thing I hate is the mode set button at the side.;0
Worst ever.;0
Portable and it works.;1
Buyer Beware, you could flush money right down the toilet.;0
Overall, I am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception.;1
It has kept up very well.;1
Great for the jawbone.;1
There's really nothing bad I can say about this headset.;0
The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.;0
As I said above....PRETTY USELESS!;0
good protection and does not make phone too bulky.;1
The phone gets EXTREMELY HOT!;0
Dont waste your money...;0
This phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used.;1
This phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful.;1
This is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.;1
poor voice clarity.;0
Works as described.;1
Excellent product.;1
"Looks great and is strong.""";1
The mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low.;0
I bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I'm very happy with my purchase.;1
Works good.;1
Nice solid keyboard.;1
Works like a charm.. Works as advertised.;1
Bought mainly for the charger, which broke soon after purchasing.;0
Battery life is real good.;1
Not worth it.;0
The reception through this headset is excellent.;1
I highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone.;1
Obviously there is a problem with the adhesive.;0
I could not recommend these more.;0
Stay Away From the Q!.;0
All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.;0
This item is fantastic and works perfectly!;1
The nano stated it.My son was dissapointed.;0
No additional ear gels provided, and no instructions whatsoever.;0
VERY comfortable.;1
You get what you pay for I guess.;0
The only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda).;0
lightweight and works well.;1
The color is even prettier than I thought it would be, and the graphics are incredibly sharp.;1
Talk about USELESS customer service.;0
Those phones are working just fine now.;1
I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.;0
They do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried.;1
This PDA rocks.;1
Great Pocket PC / phone combination.;1
)Setup couldn't have been simpler.;1
Good price.;1
Nice case, feels good in your hands.;1
It's very attractive and appears to be of good quality.;1
Provides good protection and looks classy, too.;1
Works great, when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen.;1
Made very sturdy.;1
AFTER ARGUING WITH VERIZON REGARDING THE DROPPED CALLS WE RETURNED THE PHONES AFTER TWO DAYS.;0
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.;1
If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn't it.;0
The camera, although rated at an impressive 1.3 megapixels, renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution.;0
Excellent Phone.;1
Doesn't work at all.. I bougth it for my L7c and its not working.;0
The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.;0
Then I exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same problem.;0
The phone takes FOREVER to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally.;0
:-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine.;1
It fits my ear well and is comfortable on.;1
Horrible, horrible protector.;0
You'll love how thin it is.;1
I checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.;0
Design Flaw?.;0
If I take a picture, the battery drops a bar, and starts beeping, letting me know its dieing.;0
This is infuriating.;0
I'm returning them.;0
I wish I could return the unit and get back my money.;0
Great price also!;1
Everything about this product is wrong.First;0
Also, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player.;0
It's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone (Razr) or with my previous wired headset (that plugged into an LG).;0
The delivery was on time.;1
It lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem.;0
I am pairing this with my iphone, and I could not be happier with it so far.;1
I great reception all the time.;1
A good quality bargain.. I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me.;1
Poor Reliability.;0
And none of the tones is acceptable.;0
Great Product.;1
The range is very decent, I've been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no reception/sound quality issues.;1
Unreliable - I'm giving up.;0
AFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes.;0
The worst phone I've ever had.... Only had it for a few months.;0
It has been a winner for us.;1
Obviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for.;0
Excellent sound, battery life and inconspicuous to boot!.;1
If you are Razr owner...you must have this!;1
fast service.;1
But it does get better reception and clarity than any phone I've had before.;1
All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.;1
Att is not clear, sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk.;0
The picture resolution is far below what other comparably-priced phones are offering today.;0
Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!;0
Battery lasts only a few hours.;0
Even in my BMW 3 series which is fairly quiet, I have trouble hearing what the other person is saying.;0
If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!;0
I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment, where with other phones I have not had this problem.;0
VERY DISAPPOINTED.;0
The only thing that I think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset.;0
Good product - incredible value.;1
Love This Phone.;1
Buttons are too small.;0
None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.;0
The pleather case doesn't fit.;0
I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.;0
This item is great, installed it, let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems;1
The volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown.;0
This BlueAnt Supertooth hands-free phone speaker is AWESOME.;1
Now I know that I made a wise decision.;1
The phone is sturdy and waterproof.;1
Terrible.. My car will not accept this cassette.;0
I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.;0
Love this headset!;1
Just does not work.;0
Don't buy this product - It fails!.;0
The charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work.;0
I was sitting in my vehicle, with the cradle on my belt, and the headset lost signal.;0
All three broke within two months of use.;0
I am very impressed with this headset from Plantronics.;1
It's not what it says it is.;0
