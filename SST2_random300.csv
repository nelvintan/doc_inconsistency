sentiment;review
0;this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
1;tadpole is a sophisticated , funny and good-natured treat , slight but a pleasure .
0;these spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining .
0;you 've seen them a million times .
0;the angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging .
1;finally , a genre movie that delivers -- in a couple of genres , no less .
1;a comprehensive and provocative film -- one that pushes the boundaries of biography , and challenges its audience .
0;looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due .
1;marvelous , merry and , yes , melancholy film .
1;the hours is what movies are supposed to be ...
0;ihops do n't pile on this much syrup .
1;an intelligent , earnest , intimate film that drops the ball only when it pauses for blunt exposition to make sure you 're getting its metaphysical point .
0;it 's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really does n't fit the part .
1;a pleasant enough movie , held together by skilled ensemble actors .
0;the film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but was n't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing .
1;a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy .
1;on the surface , it 's a lovers-on-the-run crime flick , but it has a lot in common with piesiewicz 's and kieslowski 's earlier work , films like the double life of veronique .
1;aside from being the funniest movie of the year , simone , andrew niccol 's brilliant anti-hollywood satire , has a wickedly eccentric enchantment to it .
0;even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles ... so it 's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that 's ultimately rather inconsequential .
0;a film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not .
0;for anyone who grew up on disney 's 1950 ### treasure island , or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor .
0;a benign but forgettable sci-fi diversion .
1;moore 's complex and important film is also , believe it or not , immensely entertaining , a david and goliath story that 's still very much playing itself out .
1;goyer 's screenplay and direction are thankfully understated , and he has drawn excellent performances from his cast .
1;thrilling , provocative and darkly funny , this timely sci-fi mystery works on so many different levels that it not only invites , it demands repeated viewings .
0;consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than ali g
0;the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there 's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction .
0;the only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare .
1;the values that have held the enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage , self-sacrifice and patience under pressure .
0;no reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned bucks into a movie which obviously did n't invest much into itself either .
1;that zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center , no less -- indicates where his ambitions have wandered .
1;mr. wedge and mr. saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well .
0;disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material .
1;a startling and fresh examination of how the bike still remains an ambiguous icon in chinese society .
1;superior genre storytelling , which gets under our skin simply by crossing the nuclear line .
0;-lrb- u -rrb- nrelentingly stupid .
0;it might as well have been problem child iv .
1;a compelling portrait of moral emptiness
1;smith 's approach is never to tease , except gently and in that way that makes us consider our own eccentricities and how they are expressed through our homes .
0;suffocated at conception by its munchausen-by-proxy mum .
1;engagingly captures the maddening and magnetic ebb and flow of friendship .
0;the issue of faith is not explored very deeply
1;binoche and magimel are perfect in these roles .
1;foster nails the role , giving a tight , focused performance illuminated by shards of feeling .
0;mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness .
0;all the necessary exposition prevents the picture from rising above your generic sand 'n' sandal adventure .
1;there is n't a weak or careless performance amongst them .
1;the film runs on equal parts of innocence and wisdom -- wisdom that comes with experience .
1;"the film is faithful to what one presumes are the book 's twin premises -- that we become who we are on the backs of our parents , but we have no idea who they were at our age ; and that time is a fleeting and precious commodity no matter how old you are ."
0;arnold 's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces .
1;never -lrb- sinks -rrb- into exploitation .
1;director ferzan ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building .
0;all ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click .
1;roman coppola may never become the filmmaker his dad was , but heck -- few filmmakers will .
0;it tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world .
1;a worthy entry into a very difficult genre .
1;it dares to be a little different , and that shading is what makes it worthwhile .
0;it will come as no surprise that the movie is n't scary .
1;... mesmerizing , an eye-opening tour of modern beijing culture in a journey of rebellion , retreat into oblivion and return .
1;the hours makes you examine your own life in much the same way its characters do , and the experience is profound .
1;even with all those rough edges safely sanded down , the american insomnia is still pretty darned good .
0;when -lrb- de palma 's -rrb- bad , he 's really bad , and femme fatale ranks with the worst he has done .
0;a gimmick in search of a movie : how to get carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned .
0;the plot is very clever , but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of .
1;sandra nettelbeck beautifully orchestrates the transformation of the chilly , neurotic , and self-absorbed martha as her heart begins to open .
1;huppert gives erika a persona that is so intriguing that you find yourself staring hypnotically at her , trying to understand her and wondering if she 'll crack .
1;nicolas philibert observes life inside a one-room schoolhouse in northern france in his documentary to be and to have , easily one of the best films of the year .
0;will only satisfy those who ca n't tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly .
0;as with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure .
1;newton draws our attention like a magnet , and acts circles around her better known co-star , mark wahlberg .
0;"one hour photo is an intriguing snapshot of one man and his delusions ; it 's just too bad it does n't have more flashes of insight ."
1;only an epic documentary could get it all down , and spike lee 's jim brown : all american at long last gives its subject a movie worthy of his talents .
1;choose your reaction : a. -rrb- that sure is funny !
1;with the film 's striking ending , one realizes that we have a long way to go before we fully understand all the sexual permutations involved .
0;a well acted and well intentioned snoozer .
1;everything you loved about it in 1982 is still there , for everybody who wants to be a kid again , or show it to their own kids .
1;a work of intricate elegance , literary lyricism and profound common sense .
1;the pianist is a fine valedictory work for polanski , made richer by his own experiences , making his other movies somehow richer in the bargain .
0;all this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull .
1;this is such a high-energy movie where the drumming and the marching are so excellent , who cares if the story 's a little weak .
1;from the big giant titles of the opening credits to elmer bernstein 's perfectly melodic score , haynes gets just about everything right .
0;lacking gravitas , macdowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel .
0;a didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy .
1;harsh , effective documentary on life in the israeli-occupied palestinian territories .
1;you have to pay attention to follow all the stories , but they 're each interesting .
1;the filmmakers skillfully evoke the sense of menace that nature holds for many urban dwellers .
0;while the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat 's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun .
0;... a weak , manipulative , pencil-thin story that is miraculously able to entertain anyway .
0;if you think that jennifer lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry ben affleck , wait till you see maid in manhattan .
1;an intriguing and entertaining introduction to johnson .
0;a long-winded , predictable scenario .
0;the only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team .
1;majidi gets uniformly engaging performances from his largely amateur cast .
0;the smug , oily demeanor that donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named pipe dream is just repulsive .
1;he 's super spy !
0;it risks seeming slow and pretentious , because it thinks the gamble is worth the promise .
0;somewhere short of tremors on the modern b-scene : neither as funny nor as clever , though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes .
1;the principals in this cast are all fine , but bishop and stevenson are standouts .
1;kaufman creates an eerie sense of not only being there at the time of these events but the very night matthew was killed .
1;it 's a brave attempt to tap into the heartbeat of the world , a salute to the universal language of rhythm and a zippy sampling of sounds .
1;call me a wimp , but i cried , not once , but three times in this animated sweet film .
0;the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs .
1;a picture that extols the virtues of comradeship and community in a spunky , spirited fashion .
1;its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time .
1;while the isle is both preposterous and thoroughly misogynistic , its vistas are incredibly beautiful to look at .
0;quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ?
1;a pleasurably jacked-up piece of action moviemaking .
1;it helps that lil bow wow ... tones down his pint-sized gangsta act to play someone who resembles a real kid .
1;painful to watch , but viewers willing to take a chance will be rewarded with two of the year 's most accomplished and riveting film performances .
1;tailored to entertain !
1;this is the best american movie about troubled teens since 1998 's whatever .
1;it almost plays like solaris , but with guns and jokes .
1;the director , steven shainberg , has succeeded by focusing intently on his characters , making them quirky individuals rather than figures of fun .
1;it 's the best film of the year so far , the benchmark against which all other best picture contenders should be measured .
1;the movie has lots of dancing and fabulous music .
0;intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area .
0;there 's not enough to sustain the comedy .
1;a distant , even sterile , yet compulsively watchable look at the sordid life of hogan 's heroes star bob crane .
1;the movie 's quiet affirmation of neighborhood values gives it an honest , lived-in glow .
1;gloriously goofy -lrb- and gory -rrb- midnight movie stuff .
1;the film 's greatest asset is how much it 's not just another connect-the-dots , spy-on-the-run picture .
1;there 's enough science to make it count as educational , and enough beauty to make it unforgettable .
0;soul is what 's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself .
1;i do n't think i 've been as entranced and appalled by an asian film since shinya tsukamoto 's iron man .
0;could the country bears really be as bad as its trailers ?
1;it never fails to engage us .
1;jason x has cheesy effects and a hoary plot , but its macabre , self-deprecating sense of humor makes up for a lot .
1;but in imax 3-d , the clichés disappear into the vertiginous perspectives opened up by the photography .
0;the film seems a dead weight .
0;it 's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic oliver parker intends to mangle next time .
0;mckay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
1;windtalkers is shapelessly gratifying , the kind of movie that invites you to pick apart its faults even as you have to admit that somehow it hit you where you live .
0;stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately serving sara does n't distinguish itself from the herd .
1;if you love motown music , you 'll love this documentary .
1;gollum 's ` performance ' is incredible !
1;the movie is one of the best examples of artful large format filmmaking you are likely to see anytime soon .

0;flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey .
1;if there 's a way to effectively teach kids about the dangers of drugs , i think it 's in projects like the -lrb- unfortunately r-rated -rrb- paid .
0;the story loses its bite in a last-minute happy ending that 's even less plausible than the rest of the picture .

0;the stories here suffer from the chosen format .
1;disturbing and brilliant documentary .
1;this warm and gentle romantic comedy has enough interesting characters to fill several movies , and its ample charms should win over the most hard-hearted cynics .
1;more a load of enjoyable , conan-esque claptrap than the punishing , special-effects soul assaults the mummy pictures represent .
0;sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre .
0;the irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted .
0;nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and showtime is crammed full of them .
1;a movie for 11-year-old boys with sports dreams of their own and the preteen girls who worship lil ' bow wow .
1;fans of behan 's work and of irish movies in general will be rewarded by borstal boy .
0;the furious coherence that -lrb- deniro -rrb- brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing .
0;never quite transcends jokester status ... and the punchline does n't live up to barry 's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery .
1;the stunning , dreamlike visuals will impress even those viewers who have little patience for euro-film pretension .
1;farrell ... thankfully manages to outshine the role and successfully plays the foil to willis 's world-weary colonel .
1;there are slow and repetitive parts , but it has just enough spice to keep it interesting .
0;as an actor , the rock is aptly named .
1;it 's the kind of pigeonhole-resisting romp that hollywood too rarely provides .
0;extremely boring .
0;like mike does n't win any points for originality .

0;like a tone-deaf singer at a benefit concert , john q. is a bad movie appearing on behalf of a good cause .
1;and if the hours wins ` best picture ' i just might .
0;madonna still ca n't act a lick .
0;a movie that , rather than skip along the seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek .

1;take care of my cat offers a refreshingly different slice of asian cinema .
1;look , this is a terrific flick replete with dazzling camera-work , dancing and music .
0;it 's never a good sign when a film 's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma .
0;the ring just left me cold and wet like i was out in the seattle drizzle without rainwear .
1;at heart the movie is a deftly wrought suspense yarn whose richer shadings work as coloring rather than substance .
1;thoughtful , provocative and entertaining .
1;in adobo , ethnicity is not just the spice , but at the heart of more universal concerns .
1;to the film 's credit , the acting is fresh and unselfconscious , and munch is a marvel of reality versus sappy sentiment .
0;anyone who can count to five -lrb- the film 's target market ? -rrb-
0;for me , this opera is n't a favorite , so it 's a long time before the fat lady sings .

0;big fat liar is just futile silliness looking to tap into the kiddie sensibilities .
1;smith profiles five extraordinary american homes , and because the owners seem fully aware of the uses and abuses of fame , it 's a pleasure to enjoy their eccentricities .
1;behind the snow games and lovable siberian huskies -lrb- plus one sheep dog -rrb- , the picture hosts a parka-wrapped dose of heart .
1;still pretentious and filled with subtext , but entertaining enough at ` face value ' to recommend to anyone looking for something different .
0;the thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker does n't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case .
1;so many documentaries like this presuppose religious bigotry or zealous nuttiness of its antagonists , but family fundamentals displays a rare gift for unflinching impartiality .
1;it is inspirational in characterizing how people from such diverse cultures share the same human and spiritual needs .
1;it will delight newcomers to the story and those who know it from bygone days .
0;every bit as bogus as most disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point .

0;credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter .
1;renner 's performance as dahmer is unforgettable , deeply absorbing .
1;the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick .
1;if nothing else , this movie introduces a promising , unusual kind of psychological horror .
0;the film is really not so much bad as bland .
1;there are as many misses as hits , but ultimately , it finds humor in the foibles of human behavior , and it 's a welcome return to the roots of a genre that should depend on surprises .
0;began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course .
1;though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work .
1;the spark of special anime magic here is unmistakable and hard to resist .
1;it 's hard not to be seduced by -lrb- witherspoon 's -rrb- charisma , even in this run-of-the-mill vehicle , because this girl knows how to drive it to the max .
1;... in this incarnation its fizz is infectious .
0;the enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized .
0;a turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull .
1;a refreshingly honest and ultimately touching tale of the sort of people usually ignored in contemporary american film .
0;proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie .
1;tender yet lacerating and darkly funny fable .
1;having never been a huge fan of dickens ' 800-page novel , it surprised me how much pleasure i had watching mcgrath 's version .
0;another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through .
0;if you 're not a prepubescent girl , you 'll be laughing at britney spears ' movie-starring debut whenever it does n't have you impatiently squinting at your watch .

0;its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing .
1;this is simply the most fun you 'll ever have with a documentary !
1;for the most part , i spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of murphy 's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies .
0;the humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny .
0;while mcfarlane 's animation lifts the film firmly above the level of other coming-of-age films ... it 's also so jarring that it 's hard to get back into the boys ' story .
0;this limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982 's tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh .
1;there are just enough twists in the tale to make it far more satisfying than almost any horror film in recent memory .
1;his characters are engaging , intimate and the dialogue is realistic and greatly moving .
0;her film is unrelentingly claustrophobic and unpleasant .
0;feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention .
0;but here 's the real damn : it is n't funny , either .
1;resourceful and ingenious entertainment .
1;if it tried to do anything more , it would fail and perhaps explode , but at this level of manic whimsy , it is just about right .
1;the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life .
0;while the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what 's supposed to be a comedy .
0;i regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough .
0;this miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing flatbush machismo will get it through .
0;and forget about any attempt at a plot !

0;the ending is a cop-out .
1;an endlessly fascinating , landmark movie that is as bold as anything the cinema has seen in years .
0;so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun .
0;say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue .
1;a tender and touching drama , based on the true story of a troubled african-american 's quest to come to terms with his origins , reveals the yearning we all have in our hearts for acceptance within the family circle .
1;this version incarnates the prophetic book in a way even its exacting author might admire .
1;impresses you with its open-endedness and surprises .
